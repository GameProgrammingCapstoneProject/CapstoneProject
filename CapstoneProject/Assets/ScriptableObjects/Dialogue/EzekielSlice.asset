  - "But yeah\u2026 "
  - maindialogue1
  - Ah, hello there friend.
  - You seem to have kept your mind somewhat intact for the time being.
  - Can I offer you a pipe? No?
  - "That\u2019s quite alright, strong and silent type I suppose. "
  - "Well, I\u2019m very willing to talk your ear off despite your quietness. "
  - Just keep sitting there if you wanna hear.
  - maindialogue2
  - Have you seen those monsters around? Seems that most of them are tinted red.
  - After I slew one, I decided to poke around in its carcass, mostly out of curiosity.
  - Seemed to have been made out of stone, but after it was slain, the red tint faded
    from the stone.
  - If I had to guess, it might be some sort of influence by Deesha, blessed be them.
  - Although they seem more hostile than the scriptures would have you believe.
  - "Maybe they\u2019ve been corrupted? It\u2019s hard to tell. "
  - "I\u2019d certainly stay far away from that red liquid; it tends to pool around
    in the area. "
  - "Most of the people I\u2019ve seen who tried it seem to not be themselves anymore.  "
  - maindialogue3
  - "From what I\u2019ve seen so far, if the red tint inhabits something small enough,
    like a shield or a chair,"
  - It will sprawl out from it, and move itself along the ground with tendrils.
  - "I\u2019ve seen most of them grab haphazard weapons, so be wary. "
  - "If the object is large instead, it\u2019ll start firing small bits of\u2026
    energy? Of some kind. "
  - "Those ones are probably the most dangerous, keep your shield up when you\u2019re
    approaching them. "
  - "I\u2019ve also seen a few that just sort of, formed into these floating spheres. "
  - "They aren\u2019t too dangerous, they just seem to lunge and flail about. "
  - "Lure them to the ground and gut them I suppose. Although that\u2019s almost
    certainly not the right word. "
  - Reminds me of the ducks around my home, they get way too friendly with people.
  - maindialogue4
  - I used to be far more religious, especially in my youth. Although, many would
    say the same.
  - "The worship of Deesha is long and storied, but fading fast from what I\u2019ve
    seen. "
  - "I\u2019m no scholar, just a merchant by trade, but in my customer base I see
    fewer and fewer believers. "
  - "A few have even tried to pawn off their idols, even after I mentioned I\u2019d
    just smelt them down for metal."
  - Perhaps Deesha lashes out at their followers, scorned and hurt by their fading
    beliefs.
  - Not that I would respond well to that. Who serves a king that scorns their subjects
    with such hostility?
  - "I hope that it\u2019s some form of outward influence corrupting these poor things. "
  - And that I leave here without one slashing at me more than necessary.
  - maindialogue5
  - Most people here seem to be in the same boat that I am, in some way.
  - "Lots of people lured here by this\u2026 influence, over the area. "
  - I remember an odd sort of scholar who came by, this massive hulking backpack
    of hers on her back.
  - She seemed to be here for academic purposes, rather than hearing this influence.
  - "I was intrigued, but not being a scholar I couldn\u2019t hold her attention
    for very long. "
  - "I hope she\u2019s doing alright here, she didn\u2019t seem very well armed. "
  - Personally I barely go anywhere without a sword and buckler, plus a hunting bow.
  - Seems the bare minimum for a merchant, with how animals can be on the road.
  - "I\u2019ve lost enough to robbery to know that it only takes a few dangerous
    people to overwhelm someone poorly armed. "
  - "Certainly I haven't regretted it before, and I\u2019m not regretting it now. "
  - maindialogue6
  - "Gods above, if I hate one thing about being trapped in this place, it\u2019s
    the pure tedium. "
  - "Why doesn\u2019t anything seem to happen? It\u2019s just monsters and the occasional
    bright face. "
  - I miss the hustle and bustle of the trade ports, or the tense unexpectedness
    of the road.
  - "Dearly, I hope that I\u2019ll be back there soon. "
  - "The only way forward is hardship, and between you and me I\u2019m just hoping
    somebody else comes along and frees us. "
  - "I\u2019m not the most experienced combattant, and my age is showing for those
    longer leaps. "
  - "Maybe it\u2019ll be you. Best fortune to yourself. "
  - playerdeath
  - Took a bit of a tumble there, didn't you?
  - Well, you seemed to have recovered well.
  - "I\u2019m not entirely sure how, but it might be the influence over this area."
  - "Hope it wasn\u2019t too painful of a return. "
  - playerkill
  - Hey, what was that for?
  - "You\u2019re lucky I need the conversation more than vengeance. "
  - "All my stuff remains, all is forgiven. Just don\u2019t do it again. "
  - playerdeathrepeat
  - You seem to be struggling quite a bit friend.
  - Maybe try the shopkeep? They sell some helpful things, might be of assistance.
  - "Or try looking before leaping. I\u2019m not sure what it could help, but people
    love to suggest it. "
  - playerkillrepeat
  - "Come on now, you don\u2019t seem of bad a sort. "
  - Why are you doing this? I admit defeat, you are superior.
  - "Just please quit it with the stabbing. It\u2019s pure pointlessness. "
  - break
