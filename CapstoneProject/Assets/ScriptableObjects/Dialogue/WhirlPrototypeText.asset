  - "Regardless\u2026"
  - 
  - Ah, good day fellow explorer. What wonderful company granted to me in such an
    odd, dreary place.
  - "I feel as though my shield has cleaved through the same foes, many times already\u2026"
  - Not of a type, but identical to one another, perhaps in soul?
  - Ah, but I am no philosopher, and you seem the type for practicality more than
    flowery language.
  - I wish you well in your endeavors, whatever they may be.
  - 
  - "Why do these caves feel familiar, yet so\u2026 incomplete?"
  - "Like a battlefield memory half remembered\u2026 I worry I am concussed from
    one of these monsters."
  - Do you feel the influence of Deesha, even now?
  - Far above this place, I still hear her siren call, beckoning me to fight upwards.
  - As foolish as I feel, I dare not forsake their call. After all, they seem in
    dire need of help.
  - I feel the essence of a soldier, a trapped ally, safe but desperate to be relieved.
  - How would I go on without granting a hand to a desperate comrade?
  - 
  - You must hear it too, this desire. Why else would one be here, otherwise?
  - The last of the treasures and worthwhile weapons have long since been looted.
  - "Although I suppose these monsters do drop these odd, thin trinkets\u2026 but
    what use would these have?"
  - "I have not seen a blacksmith who could repair my armor and, even if I did, I
    wouldn\u2019t have a scrap of real coin to pay him with."
  - I suppose I must remember that the true gift for us here is camaraderie, especially
    seeing as many here are corrupted or unwell.
  - I would go so far as to say that, if only I had a forge, I would assist others
    in repairs at no cost.
  - Odd for a soldier to feel such closeness to those not on their side of the conflict.
  - "Although\u2026 does this war we\u2019re fighting have sides? We all seem compelled
    upwards by the same force."
  - 
  - "Come to think of it\u2026 I cannot even remember how I arrived at this place."
  - "I know my regiment was dissolved, and I moved on\u2026 beginning to wander as
    a mercenary."
  - Past that point, I know not where this underworld we are in lies.
  - But, were I dead, would I not show signs of wounds, or memories of pain?
  - The majority of what I can trust is simple steel and grit.
  - In that respect, I suppose little has changed from my former fighting days.
  - Although I had more concrete purpose then, holding the line with my countrymen.
  - The twinges of guilt I once felt in the protection of my country, I no longer
    feel defending myself from these monstrous beings.
  - The influence of Deesha, perhaps? Or are these things truly inhuman?
  - After all, they seem to bleed red, same as you or I.
  - "Hmm\u2026 a true predicament, we seem to have fallen into."
  - But only one direction left to go. Upwards and over, whatever it entails.
  - 
  - Ah! It is good to see you well, friend.
  - I suppose count yourself lucky that this was a fate of no consequence.
  - "Reminds me of my training days, beating against the wood with my mentor\u2026"
  - "Just, be cautious\u2026 Such leniency towards the underworld is no way to conduct
    oneself."
  - Especially on a true battlefield.
  - 
  - Have you little respect for yourself or others, sir?
  - Gah, no matter. Neither of us can truly perish here.
  - A flash of pain in the pan is of no matter in the future.
  - But I dare ask, refrain, as my armor wears thin on my back.
  - 
  - "Prone to taking falls, friend? Haha\u2026"
  - But outside of humor, I feel the need to impart some veterans advice.
  - It may be good to proceed a little more cautiously, rather than rushing headfirst
    into danger.
  - Why not sit with me for a while? We might contemplate your problems.
  - Although, unless you speak, I cannot know what truly ails you.
  - Nothing wrong with having a thinking partner, however. So please, be cautious?
  - I fear that our luck may run short if we rely on the immortal nature of this
    place for too long.
  - 
  - I feel pained and targeted, friend!
  - You seem to have your wits about you enough to listen, so please, stay your blade!
  - "Goodness\u2026 I suppose I will be thankful the only lingering damage is emotional."
  - As good of a reason to forgive you as anything else, yes?
  -
