  dialogueText:
  - "Ahem\u2026 Anyways\u2026"
  - maindialogue1
  - "Good day to you. I am Emelia, historian, archeologist, philosopher\u2026"
  - Actually, upon consideration, you do not seem learned. I will not bombard you
    with titles as I normally would.
  - I figured that the only interest in this place would be historical in nature,
    no?
  - Yet I seem to be surrounded purely by brutes, soldiers and monsters.
  - "You\u2019ve listened longer than most of the others though. Do I see some amount
    of curiosity?"
  - Well, it is always a good day to learn. Sit and listen, if you care.
  - I will take your silence and listening as consent to go over my notes, assuming
    you are truly mute.
  - maindialogue2
  - "I\u2019ve heard of a location similar to this before, a great tower in the lower
    steppes."
  - It seems to have been originally built as a religious site to a deity named Deesha.
  - Supposedly, they are chained to rocks suspended in the air above the tower.
  - Although all sources point to this, oddly, being a literal phenomenon, rather
    than metaphor.
  - This location seems similar, although I arrived here seeking the original tower.
  - "Thank whatever lays above that I brought my scribing tools, I\u2019d be at such
    a loss for what to do otherwise."
  - As for this location, it bears some similarities to this place.
  - Mostly, the same types of odd fauna seem to be present here as in the other location.
  - As well, the basic mechanics of being driven upward and resurrection are both
    intact.
  - "With this information in mind, I have a working theory\u2026"
  - maindialogue3
  - I would say that this area appears to be a precursor to the tower itself.
  - "Think of it as a sort of \u201Cproto-tower\u201D which was formed earlier."
  - Some of the dating on the chiseled stone here would indicate a very ancient tomb,
    indeed.
  - Perhaps, this is where Deesha was initially held, with his influence corrupting
    the surroundings,
  - Even after they were moved, their corruption remains in some forms.
  - "In this sense, perhaps it\u2019s an even greater discovery than I anticipated."
  - Although the tower might hold more relevance for my research.
  - I still wish to be rid of this place as soon as I reasonably can.
  - "Assuming a way out doesn\u2019t make itself known before my research concludes."
  - That, of course, leads to the next step of confirming my theory.
  - Why were they held here initially, and why were they moved?
  - In addition, how could their latent influence still be felt for this long?
  - "I\u2019m no theologen, but even I understand the power that deities hold here."
  - "Even so, for the influence to be this present and forceful\u2026"
  - I feel it a sign of deep anger, or spite. Perhaps towards us, or the world.
  - More than usual, I would advise caution, moving forward.
  - maindialogue4
  - My theory still has a great number of holes at this stage.
  - Mainly, how this odd, red substance factors into my thoughts.
  - "It seems to be a commonality with the more\u2026 depraved creatures here."
  - It bears a striking resemblance to blood, but does not clot or dry.
  - I almost feel subjected to some kind of cosmic riddle.
  - My teachers did not equip me for asking myself questions like,
  - "\u201CDid the chicken or the egg come first?\u201D"
  - What is blood but does not clot, dry or run?
  - Perhaps if the question remains unanswered, another can follow up on my findings.
  - I am assuming this area will soon be plundered by less spry researchers.
  - For now, I will count myself lucky I made it first.
  - Especially as I tire of learning purely from others. I must pull information,
    with my own hands now.
  - maindialogue5
  - You know, my prior learning was purely theoretical, and I only just got away
    from dusty scrolls and rote hypotheses.
  - Naturally, the first location I receive permission to investigate in person,
    is a death trap.
  - My crossbow has served me well in self defense, but it was purely of my own doing
    that I brought it.
  - "I\u2019ve had to survive by the skin of my teeth and with the little knowledge
    of survival granted by my notes. "
  - Truly, my circumstances have utterly ruined my future prospects, unless someone
    fulfills Deeshas request.
  - I desperately hope someone does so; I long for a new venture, less killing and
    more research.
  - maindialogue6
  - Nothing to be done but to continue onwards and upwards, I suppose.
  - "Perhaps I\u2019ll find a compatriot that can join me, slow as I am to move and
    progress. "
  - I lack your dexterity, and would merely slow your ascent. As such, I dare not
    chain myself to your legs.
  - I doubt I am capable of freeing a deity without any measure of assistance, especially
    considering my lack of arms.
  - If you have any suggestions, feel free to write them, listener.
  - "Although\u2026 potentially you may be illiterate as well as mute. Would just
    be my luck. "
  - No matter, we will prevail eventually. I cannot be lost here, lest my studies
    go unfinished.
  - break
  - "Well\u2026 That\u2019s quite intriguing, isn\u2019t it? I could swear I witnessed 
    dialogueSize: 97 your death."
  - "Yet I don\u2019t even see a scratch on you from beforehand."
  - "I wish that I had some practical medical expertise right now\u2026"
  - No basis to form a hypothesis without doing something brutish.
  - "Although, I suppose it wouldn\u2019t affect you in the long term anyways."
  - playerkill
  - "\u2026Sorry, you seem to have caught me lost in thought."
  - I could swear that you have killed me before.
  - At first I assumed it was a hallucination, something from the cave.
  - But I seem to be well in all other senses.
  - Assuming that something happened, simply refrain from repeating it.
  - "The distress of the experience is outweighed by the interesting research implications\u2026"
  - playerdeathrepeat
  - "\u2026I suppose something can be said about your resilience."
  - Or at least, whatever force is returning you from the clutches of death.
  - "Such miraculously low odds of survival\u2026 It must be the influence of this
    strange location."
  - Nothing that contradicts my existing theories. Although I must be thorough.
  - It could, ultimately, just be luck.
  - playerkillrepeat
  - "\u2026Alright, I am not sure of what exactly you\u2019re doing."
  - But regardless, stop. I tire of having to reorganize my notes.
  - "The last time you\u2026 \u201Ckilled\u2019 me, I lost a few pages of research,
    too."
  - "It\u2019s far too important to be lost to pointless sadism."
  - break
