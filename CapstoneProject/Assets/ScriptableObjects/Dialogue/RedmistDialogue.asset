  dialogueText:
  - Go, leave me.
  - maindialogue1
  - 'Glorious day to you, combattant. '
  - 'I am known as Redmist, a name earned in combat and strife. '
  - 'My kill count of the beasts that lay in this drab tomb is fifty-two and counting. '
  - "\u2026Your silent demeanor tells me that you are in awe of this!  "
  - 'Good! For I will be the greatest of champions to venture into this battlefield! '
  - 'Although I am sure you are accomplished yourself. You have made it down this
    far, after all. '
  - maindialogue2
  - 'If you have reached this far, surely you have seen some of the fodder that lay
    around. '
  - 'I have splayed them across the stone above, and have continued to do so with
    them here. '
  - 'Applaud yourself, for you have pleased those above for your work. '
  - 'No life lays behind their eyes, yet they shamble and kill as any beast would. '
  - 'Despicable! I will purge them myself, every one! '
  - 'Although the ones that spit energy are particularly annoying. '
  - 'I would recommend you respond in kind, seeing as you are of magical ability. '
  - 'As cowardly as I find the prospect, I suppose that it is effective. '
  - maindialogue3
  - 'I would never part with my axe, Aqas. '
  - 'She is my companion on the battlefield, true and consistent. '
  - Keeps an edge like no other, proven with the blood of these fiends.
  - "Or\u2026 blood? It feels of a similar texture, but more animated.  "
  - I see it twitch occasionally, on the edge of my blade, even hours after my last
    kill.
  - It is of little matter, they die all the same.
  - My will is certain! I will continue without care for the pointless details.
  - maindialogue4
  - Quite unlike that scholar above. I believe Emelia was her name.
  - She stood around examining my kills like a stray cat!
  - "Small wonder that she hasn\u2019t made it this far down yet. "
  - I will be the one who cleaves to the bottom of this cave.
  - For all I have back home, and the promises I made to my brothers and sisters.
  - "Besides, if I do not see success\u2026 "
  - I will have little to return to, as a warrior.
  - maindialogue5
  - "Ugh\u2026 What is this melancholy that hangs in the air? "
  - I despise the atmosphere here, the utter lack of celebration for my conquest.
  - "I\u2019ve no choice but to continue cleaving, of course. "
  - But a battle must eventually end, and a warrior rewarded for her fight.
  - As much as I call into the caves and hear my voice echo back,
  - It feels less and less like my normal warcry by the minute.
  - maindialogue6
  - Perhaps I am finally in need of rest.
  - My blade will still for a time, and I will breathe and reassert myself.
  - "Then, I will continue on\u2026 "
  - Destroy more of these things, no matter how many stand between myself and the
    end.
  - You shall do the same! Go now!
  - Perhaps you will match my count. I will count the cries of each defeated foe.
  - break
