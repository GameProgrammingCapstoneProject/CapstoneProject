  - "Go on then\u2026"
  - maindialogue1
  - "Gah! Don\u2019t run up so quickly like that\u2026 I almost dropped a potion. "
  - "Well, what could you possibly want? Don\u2019t you have some galavanting to
    do? "
  - "Lots to do to save Deesha, or however you want to talk about it\u2026 "
  - Why not do that instead of scaring old women?
  - maindialogue2
  - "Oh, fine, if you\u2019re intent on staying\u2026 "
  - Why are you here anyways? Better not be for them.
  - Deesha is an awful thing to worship, their influence does nothing but corrupt.
  - "We\u2019re in a death trap of their creation, at the minute. "
  - And yet everyone except that merchant, Ezekiel, seems stuck in their grasp.
  - Either directly, or just getting into the spirit of the murder here.
  - "You\uFFFDve already killed a bunch, haven't you?"
  - "Then you\u2019re falling right into its trap. "
  - maindialogue3
  - Wanna know a secret?
  - My old village was completely wiped out by Deesha, influencing some soldiers.
  - Those soldiers razed it to the ground as a gift to them.
  - Anyone who supports Deesha is just too foolish to smell the corpses.
  - "I hope you aren\u2019t the same. You aren\u2019t so glassy eyed as to pass over
    me at least. "
  - "You may not even be one of the faith\u2026 although, then why are you here?"
  - maindialogue4
  - Just be warned then, I suppose.
  - Deesha is not benevolent, nor will you be rewarded for freeing them.
  - "In all likelihood, they\u2019ll use you for evil as they have used most others. "
  - I am only here to turn others around from them, and failing that, lodge a knife
    in their back.
  - Before they become fully lost to the bloodlust and end up killing somebody.
  - "There\u2019s not much left for me out there anyways, even if I am trapped. "
  - maindialogue5
  - "Also\u2026 some of the soldiers raided the village. "
  - They took a few heirlooms with them, and then came here.
  - Hopefully, I can recover them from their bodies before I get out of here.
  - "I\u2019ve found a handful already.. Drawings and jewelry, mostly. "
  - I hope to be able to find the rest. And let me know if you see any more corpses
    of soldiers.
  - "I\u2019ll need to check every one I come across. "
  - maindialogue6
  - Oh, and try not to get killed. Some parts of you are lost to Deesha whenever
    it happens.
  - "I suspect that\u2019s how those monsters are formed\u2026 "
  - Monsters made from bits, scraped off you every time you die.
  - What a horrifying thought, right?
  - "Lambs to the slaughter, all of them\u2026 "
  - break
